Real-time distance measurement is often unavailable in a stereo vision measurement system because of large amount of calculation and hardware limitation. In this paper, the key technologies of binocular stereo vision are introduced. The method of pre-calibration is used along with a fast stereo matching algorithm and optimized parameters to achieve the target real time tracking and measurement by the dynamic disparity search combined with the target tracking algorithm. Experiments indicate the low cost system has high feasibility and achieves real-time tracking and measurement of object with precision in a certain range.
