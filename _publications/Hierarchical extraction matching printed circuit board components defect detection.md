A hierarchical extraction classification matching algorithm based on mathematical morphology and seed filling is proposed， to detect the defects of printed circuit board ( PCB) ， include the missing and cocked of chip resistors and capacitors，also include the missing and polarity errors of IC chip． The algorithm is divided into three parts: PCB image preprocessing，hierarchical extraction and template classification．The key to the algorithm is to eliminate irrelevant information interference and the various components of PCB are extracted by seed filling algorithm． And then different components were based on single-linked list of template classification and matching． This algorithm is used to detect PCB samples with a length of 19 cm and a width of 13.5 cm，in the case of ensuring a precision of 0.1 mm or more，the fastest detection speed can be up to 2 sec /block．
